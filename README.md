## Overview

gRPC-Web provides a Javascript client library that enables browser clients to
access a gRPC server.

The current release is a Pre-Alpha release, mainly for early adopters to provide
feedback on the JS API (both gRPC and Protobuf). The JS client library
and the gateway that connects the client to the server are subject to change
and will be upgraded frequently.

We expect to ship a beta version in Q1/2017, which will implement an
official protocol spec for supporting Web clients. Stay tuned!
